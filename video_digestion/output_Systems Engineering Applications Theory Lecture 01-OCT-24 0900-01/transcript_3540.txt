The fire service will happily go and deal with fires. The ambulance service will go and deal with accidents and incidents, and the police, similar. If we have a big incident that needs an incident response, then all of those individual systems and others need to come together and operate as a single system for a small period of time. It's that sort of thing that we're talking about when we talk about system of systems, because that integration isn't something that's permanent. That integration, their systems coming together, being able to operate together, being able to communicate together, happens for a specific instance in time. And then they have to be able to go back and do their original jobs. There are some other examples of that, but this is why it's really important. We have loads of models as to what that system of systems and what that integration protocol may be like.
