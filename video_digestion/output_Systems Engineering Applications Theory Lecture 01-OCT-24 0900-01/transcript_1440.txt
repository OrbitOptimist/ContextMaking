You will quickly know about me as I'm a big fan of a diagram. This is what we call a transformational system. So we start with an input, we do something to it, we end up with an output. Nice and simple and straightforward. And sometimes breaking our systems down and representing them in this way is absolutely what we need to do. It hides some of the complexity, but it depends on the message that we're trying to communicate. Now whilst the input, process, output represents a system, we also have some systems in there. So we can consider these things in as part of that system as systems in their own right. So our process is a delivery system. It takes things in, gives things out, produces something. But that thing that we produce is probably a system as well, so that's the delivered system. And all around both the delivery system and the delivered systems, we may have maintenance, training, all sorts of other support that's going on there.
