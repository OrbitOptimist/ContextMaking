If you do have individual questions, there will always be time for class questions, but if you do have individual questions, you're more than welcome to come and catch me at the end of the session as well. And that will be true as we go. So the next session, we are back here at nine on Tuesday. You will notice, if you've looked ahead in your timetable, you'll notice that from about week five, we've got some sessions on a Friday as well. Those are related to coursework too, so we will get to those. But next week, we'll be back, how's it say, we'll be back in here. Check where we are in your timetable. But next week, we'll be talking about coursework one, specifically, and we'll be looking at requirements. In the meantime, review the coursework information sheets. They will be on Learn within the next couple of days. And if you have any questions about coursework one, then come to the next session ready with those. And just have a think about requirements engineering. Why do you think that might be important? And what do you think the purpose of a dishwasher and a train are? And we will come to that in an activity in the next session.
