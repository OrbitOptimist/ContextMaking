and get feedback on your progress for that as we go. I'll also be doing general feedback in the lecture session, so if after one of the workshops I've had a lot of the same questions there's obviously something that isn't being well understood, then I'll go back and give some more feedback and uncover some of those topics as much as I can. Feedback on summative assessments, so where marks are available, so coursework will be formally marked and you will get detailed individual feedback and I will also do some feedback lectures for each of those sessions. Typically the feedback lecture for coursework 1 will be delivered in one of these sessions. The feedback session or the general feedback for coursework 2 and 3 tends to come as an upload to learn but if anybody does want to talk to me about it at that point that's absolutely fine and that's usually because by the time the feedback is available for coursework 2 and 3 we've squarely hit exam time.
