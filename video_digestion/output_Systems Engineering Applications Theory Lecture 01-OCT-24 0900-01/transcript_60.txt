So, developing your own systems approach, one of the things, or one of the reasons that we're starting today in terms of integration and tailoring your approach is there's lots of different tools that we can look at, but actually the overall principle of a systems approach is that integration. So, it's not just picking one tool and picking another tool, it's making sure those two tools are going to work together, or those methods are going to work together, and making sure that they are appropriate for the context that we're working in. And all of that gets a bit subjective, so we need to learn how to judge and evaluate those things. Okay, so, general plan for the module. Subject to a little bit of change, but actually I'm not anticipating much change for this session. So, today, here we are, module introduction, systems recap, integration. Next week I will go, so I'm going to talk to you about the coursework this morning.
