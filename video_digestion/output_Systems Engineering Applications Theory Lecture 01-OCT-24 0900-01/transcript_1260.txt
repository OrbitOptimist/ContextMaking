So then, going forward, we have systems engineering. Now, for a lot of people, when we talk about it, it's just common sense. And in a lot of ways, yeah, it is common sense. Unfortunately, there's not all that much common sense around. So we have this structured approach to doing what we're trying to do. It is about engineering the system as a whole, across its whole life cycle, and all the requirements for the system. All the different things that people want, all the different technical requirements, we bring all of those in. So systems engineering is taking that systems approach and applying it to the creation, brand new, redesign, whatever, of a system. Now, lots of different definitions for systems engineering beyond that. So we talk about this interdisciplinary approach, and I'm going to pick up on a couple of the key things here. An interdisciplinary approach is absolutely what we're looking at here.
