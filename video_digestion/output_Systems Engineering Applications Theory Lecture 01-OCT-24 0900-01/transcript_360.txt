people on this module. So we're going to have about 13 groups. Typically, I ask you to sort of give feedback to three or four other groups, okay? And it's really structured in terms of what you get asked to do. More to come on that when we introduce coursework two and coursework three. Okay, so feedback plans. So formative feedback, so developmental feedback, stuff to support you will be available at each of the workshop sessions. You can, as I say, ask questions in the lecture sessions as well, but there will be some sessions that are much more dedicated to you doing stuff, and I will be wandering around. There may well be some others supporting me with that to see how you're getting on and to give you feedback as you go. When you're doing that, so in the workshop sessions, once we get past requirements, once we head into systems design, you are absolutely welcome to work on the coursework during those sessions.
