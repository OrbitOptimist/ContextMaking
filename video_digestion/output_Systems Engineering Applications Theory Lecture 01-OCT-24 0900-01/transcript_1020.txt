It's because it is completely up to you where that system definition lies. And so it's important that you understand what it is you're trying to do to help you form that boundary, to help you form that system perception. In COSI, the International Council on Systems Engineering, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the UK chapter starting at the moment, and they say a system is an integrated set of elements. So that was similar to the previous slide. To accomplish a defined objective, yep, got that as well, that's our purpose. But these can include hardware, software, firmware, people, information techniques, facility services, and other support elements, and probably a whole host of other things as well. So we can put all sorts of things in our system. System will have a variety of features, so it has these objectives that we've talked about, this purpose. It will have subsystems, so things that make it up, so we can view the subsystem.
