Email me, absolutely fine, but you'll be given guidance on how to find the solution for yourself. Hopefully you will find these sessions useful. They are designed to be... You'll get a chance to experience some of the tools. We've got quite a lot of hands-on activities for you to do. This is a good opportunity to ask questions, both of me and the support, team peer support. For the majority of these sessions, especially where I'm going to get you to do an activity, then we're going to be in a room like this. So when you get into your groups or when you're in groups and you're doing the activities, please chat with the people that are around you. That's why we're in this sort of space. Some of the sessions we are in a lecture room. So the other sort of flag is, please check the timetables because we are not in the same room every time. Yes, and there will be extra information and context setting, which is a really nice way to say that I will set off and rumble every now and then.
