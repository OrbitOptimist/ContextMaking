Because those sorts of things will change. We can do something called rapid application development. That may be something that you've heard of, things like competitive piloting, which we'll come on to in our system design session, framework architecture or re-engineering existing systems. So we need to think about what it is that's important and what sort of situation we have. One of the overall factors that you will need to consider in terms of which approach is appropriate for you is the risk, the risk level that you have. Is this something that you've done before? Is this something that anybody has done before? Are you putting a lot of money into this, a lot of time into this? If everything goes wrong, have you got time to fix it? Those are the sorts of questions that you need to ask in terms of risk. So it might be to do with the size of the system, the nature of the risks. So if the risks are early, then that's good, late risks are less good.
