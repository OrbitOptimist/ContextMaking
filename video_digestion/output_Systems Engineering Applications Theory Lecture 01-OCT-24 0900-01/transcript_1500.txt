Transformation itself is a system. And it may be all sorts of different things, so our inputs may be statement of need, may be requirements, may be raw materials that we do something to in order to get a nice output at the end. Transformation is not the only way that we can present a system. And again, so one of the points that I want to make here is sort of like if what you're looking at is a process, and this now sort of process works quite nicely for you, if what you're looking at is more of an organisational system, then different sorts of representations and different sorts of considerations will be good. So we need to understand what it is that we're trying to do. So this is a system of interest diagram. We represent different things on here. So our system of interest is there in the bottom right-hand corner, and we've got wider boundaries, wider systems, elements in the system environment. And so sometimes we have one boundary, sometimes we can see two boundaries, sometimes we can see three boundaries, sometimes we can see four boundaries, sometimes we can see five
