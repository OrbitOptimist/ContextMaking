[1560s - 1620s]
set a couple of different boundaries to understand, again, depending on what it is we're trying to represent. So why? Why are we bothering? Why are you all sat here on a lovely, wintry Tuesday morning? So we've got our traditional approach to engineering, which typically is what we call solutioneering. So we see a problem. We see a solution. We've done it before. We know it works. It's worked in the past. We'll get there. Do you know what? We'll get there in the end. And we see this far too often, and we end up with a need for redesign. There's pretty much every day a large engineering project that has late delivery, cost overruns. We have lots of testing, more testing than we perhaps need. And as a human factors person, I love people. They're brilliant and absolutely essential, but we don't want them at the end of this solving all our problems and trying to do the firefighting. I don't mean literally. I mean trying to solve the problems at the end. They can be brilliant, but we don't want them to have to get us out.
