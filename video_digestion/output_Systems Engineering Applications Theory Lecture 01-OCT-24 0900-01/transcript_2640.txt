So, integration is inextricably linked with validation and verification. We have to absolutely check as we go and verify and validate as we go. I appreciate there's a full lecture coming on validation and verification, but at a very basic level, when we're talking about validation, we're checking that we've made the right system. So, we're checking that we've made the system that the customer wants, that's validation. And verification is about making sure that the system works as it should do. So, have we built it right, and have we built the right thing? That's what we're talking about in terms of verification and validation. We assemble our system consistent with architectural design, and we'll come back to what we mean. So, systems architecture is linked to the more traditional version and philosophy of architecture. We'll come back to that a little bit in system design. We need interface requirements, so we don't just design our interfaces, we need to understand what those requirements are, and the requirements, in that case, may be generated by the customer.
