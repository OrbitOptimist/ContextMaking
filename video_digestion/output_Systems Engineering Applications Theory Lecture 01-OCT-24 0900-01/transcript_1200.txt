All sorts of different systems around us, and when we talk about the systems that you're going to use for your coursework, whether that be coursework 1 or coursework 2, could be any sort of system, physical, organisational, biological, social systems, nervous systems, not to mention the physical systems of the more traditional planes, trains, automobiles that we look at quite regularly in terms of systems engineering. This is why we did that definition of systems first, because the definition of a systems approach is applying systems thinking in a systematic and repeatable manner. I'm sure there's a definition in English which says you shouldn't use the word to define the word you're trying to define, but never mind. This is what we're doing. We're taking that concept of a system, we are applying it in a systematic way to try and understand something.
