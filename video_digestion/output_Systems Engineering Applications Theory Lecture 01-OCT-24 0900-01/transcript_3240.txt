So briefly mentioned incremental. It's a bit like sequential approach, but then we implement in parts. So we implement bits at a time. Normally the most cost effective parts are implemented first, so we get a baseline. And then we add extra bits on top of that. This can be really nice if what you need is something that works quick. But perhaps not the overall system. Useful theoretical concepts rarely encountered in a pure form. You will see it as part of other development processes. Evolutionary lifecycle, again, very similar to the previous ones. But we have this period of operational use to gain feedback. So we develop something, we give it to the users, they give us feedback, we do it again. First versions are small. Again, if what we want to do is get to market, then we can get this product quickly.
