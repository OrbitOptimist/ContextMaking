Because it means that we can't break it down into individual components and hope to understand the system level behaviour because there will be stuff that happens in between those components. The system will work in a different way, it will fail in a different way. These interactions and our place within the environment will modify the behaviour that our system has. In the past, we wanted to get rid of emergent properties. We didn't know what they were and we didn't like them because they weren't a surprise. Whereas now, actually, one of the big benefits of some of the complex systems don't come from those little bits, so we have to embrace emergent behaviour. We can start predicting it and we can start exploiting it to get the overall behaviour that we want. We know that a collection of excellent parts can make a poor system and a collection of adequate parts can be used to make a very good system. That works for technical systems just as much as it works for people and teams as well.
