Coursework 3 is an individual piece of work. So we go back to the individual piece of work. It's worth the last 20% of the module. It is based on coursework 2 and it is a self and peer assessment. So the group work, largely group mark, unless there is clear evidence, then we've got ways, and I'll talk to you about the monitoring and the metrics for checking group participation, but typically people get the group mark for that. The peer assessment then comes in coursework 3, which is an individual piece of work, and for that you do three things. Relatively small pieces of work for each of these. We're talking sort of a side of a four each. You're going to be doing a peer assessment of your group, so the group that you're working with, you will do a peer assessment with them. You will do a self-reflection, so you will reflect on your own progress, and you will be giving peer feedback to some other groups in the cohort. So I think we've got just over 50%.
