This is when we get into this iterative process, and the fact that we have an iterative process is brilliant. And this links to other processes, so you may have come across things such as IPD, so integrated product design, and HCI, human systems integration. All of these things overlap. So we like things to change, we like to be flexible for as long as possible, and every successful system will or has changed as we go along. When we think about that, we need to sort of think, so if your reaction is, well, this system can't change, then you need to understand how you build that into the process and where you do it early. So things that seem fixed, like a building, will have huge amounts of modeling done.
