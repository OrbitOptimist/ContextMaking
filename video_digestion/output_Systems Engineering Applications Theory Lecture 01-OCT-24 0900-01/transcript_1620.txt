of those problems at the end of the process. And the reason for this is because that's all based on reductionist thinking. So we break our system down into individual components, and we focus on those. We focus on those little individual things. We think that if each effect has one cause, something happened, this was the problem. We see it a lot in things like human error. So we'll say, well, that person pressed that button, and that thing happened. So it's their fault, and it was because they pressed the button. So what we're going to do is we're going to put a cage around the button so that we can't press the button anymore. Not thinking or wondering why that person thought that was a good idea in the first place. Because people generally don't like to create catastrophe. So we need to take a step back and understand what's going on. We cannot break our big problem into little problems, not without understanding the integration. Because we need to think about this emergent behavior, this thing that happens in between the parts, the relationships, the dependencies, the interactions.
