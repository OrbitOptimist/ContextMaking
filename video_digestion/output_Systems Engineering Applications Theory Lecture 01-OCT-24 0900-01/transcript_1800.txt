Now, any of these loops could be that re-evaluate or any of those re-evaluates on there. So, it explains what we're doing and gives us some structure to that. Okay. Have we come across V-diagrams before? Yeah. A few hands up. I hate V-diagrams. I don't like them. It's one of the few places that I use them, but that's fine. One of the reasons that... I feel like I need to explain that now. One of the reasons that I don't like V-diagrams is because nine times out of ten, when people do a systems approach, they go, it's fine, I'm doing systems engineering because, look, I've got a V-diagram. They don't really know what it is, they don't really know what it's for, and they haven't checked whether that's the appropriate process for them to be using or the appropriate structure for them to be using for their project, process, whatever. So, if you do show me a V-diagram, make sure it's appropriate and tailor it. So, I want to know what's going on. When you're talking about requirements capture on your V-diagram, how are you doing that? Put some detail in there.
