Also, if we've got a relatively short overall life cycle, so, for example, in terms of your projects this year, this can work really nicely. Reduces the risk involved in taking a long time to supply a product, which turns out that it may not be what the users want. So we use a lot of methods that come under co-design, in terms of human factors, and that falls under this evolutionary life cycle. So you get early delivery, more realistic feedback, you get to find out what works and what doesn't, and hopefully you get to that full functionality quicker as well. Requires care. So you may need to rework things, your planning horizon is limited, the future's inherently unpredictable, things may happen that are outside your control. As I said, you may consider things like rapid application development, which links to Agile, has anybody used Agile processes?
