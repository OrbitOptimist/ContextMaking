And can reduce the risk. Because at the end of the day, the overall goal of what we're trying to do is to deliver an operational capability. Chances are the customer doesn't really care about how you get there. They just want the product that does the thing that they want it to do. So we're looking at defining the required capability and providing resources to create that capability. And that links really nicely with our requirements and our design sessions with validation verification, providing us the understanding that whether we have got the right capability and whether we can deliver that capability. So we've got capability development, system development, and then special components apply. And that gives us our layers. So we start at the capability stage. This is what we want to be able to achieve. This is the system that's going to deliver that capability. And these are the components, the subsystems that comprise that system that delivers that capability. Thank you.
