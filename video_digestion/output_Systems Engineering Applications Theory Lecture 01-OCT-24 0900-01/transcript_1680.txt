Because that is where the fun stuff happens. It is abstract. So system thinking is abstract, which is great because we can use different representations. We can take different viewpoints, different perspectives, and try and understand these underlying patterns and what is going on. Some engineers don't like the whole approach because it takes you longer to get to build. And very much as engineers, we like to get going. We like to feel like we're doing something productive. And what we're going to try and encourage you on this module is to just take a step back and understand the problem first. Not for very long, not for a huge amount of time, but if we take just a little bit more time to understand the problem, then it makes our overall process easier and more straightforward. You will see a lot of different systems engineering processes. I think there's a couple more coming as we go. This one I quite like.
