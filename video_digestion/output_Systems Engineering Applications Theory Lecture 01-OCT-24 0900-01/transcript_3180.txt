Volatility in the technology, is this new technology? Predictability, so do we know operational scenarios, when the system is used, do we know what's going to happen? How good are the people going to be when they are using our system? And the degree and novelty. As we've already talked about, another driver here may be the priority, so what is the priority? Getting functionality quickly to users, do we need to be first to market? Are we racing a competitor here, and is that really important? Or actually, have we, as a company or an organisation, built a reputation that says our products are reliable? Because actually, if that's what we sell on, if that's what our business is built on, then reliability is much more important than speed. All sorts of different things. These will lead you to different development approaches and different overall systems approaches as well.
