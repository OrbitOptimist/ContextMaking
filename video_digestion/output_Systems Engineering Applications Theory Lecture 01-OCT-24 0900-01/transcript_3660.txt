Complexity, novelty, and size of the systems that we are typically working with, combined to make a sequential approach, by itself unrealistic. So, tailoring your approach, as I've said, is necessary given your context. Understanding all such take and how these integrate is part of your approach. So, when we talk about integration, yes, we're talking about physical integration, we're talking about getting all of the components to work together. In terms of where you do that on the program, you'll do that elsewhere. Different modules will take care of the technical aspects of integration. We're talking about the theory of it here.
