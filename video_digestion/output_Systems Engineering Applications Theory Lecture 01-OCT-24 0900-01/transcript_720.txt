[720s - 780s]
And we'll come back to that next week. You will see as we go that I've set some tasks for you to do outside the sessions. Do them, hopefully, and they are there to make the sessions more effective, to make the contact time more effective, to enable you in the sessions to ask good questions rather than just try and tackle the activities. So when you can, then please get ahead with those. If you're stuck, ask questions. Chances are, as I've already said, someone is doing the same thing. Do some research. The library is great for that sort of thing, and we can point you in the right direction for that. There will be forums for both tutor and peer support, so if a question goes on Teams that you think you know the answer to, then please feel free to answer those. And as I said, yeah, I knew this was coming.
