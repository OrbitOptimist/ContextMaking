[1860s - 1920s]
But they are useful for some things. One of the great things about V-diagrams is these horizontal lines that go across in the middle. And they are important because when we're starting to think about identifying our need at the start, we're thinking about how we're going to validate that. This is the need, this is what the customer wants. How are we going to check that we've delivered what they want at the end? When we're looking at the requirements capture, how are we going to test them? How are we going to verify that we've met those requirements? So that's looking ahead when we're doing the design. How are we going to integrate it? All of that looking ahead is really, really useful. So if you take nothing else away from a V-diagram, then do use that. And when you get into detailed design, you may have another one. We can nest our V-diagrams, that is absolutely fine. You may see some spiral models. Spiral models are an evolution of our iterative leaps.
