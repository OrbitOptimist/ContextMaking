We've done lots of modeling and can we use that iteration for our lower level components because all of that has an impact for integration and how we do that integration. Whatever your approach is, it must be tailored. We talk about all these different levels of approach. We talk about B-levels. We talk about iteration. We're going to talk about some life cycle development approaches as well. You don't have to use one for the whole project. You can take bits from different stages. You can do one in development, one in operation, all sorts of different things. Restructuring individual steps of a sequential approach using elements of a more intricate life cycle is absolutely fine. That's why I say if you've got a V-diagram, tell me what's going on in each of those boxes. We're going to talk about evolutionary incremental approaches where we look at optimizing those things step by step. What we are trying to avoid ...
