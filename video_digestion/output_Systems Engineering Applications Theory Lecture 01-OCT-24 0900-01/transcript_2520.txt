and the people get left to left. So we are desperately trying to change that process, but let's sort out the people first and sort out what they need and who they are and how we get them comfortable and then design the rest of the system around them. So the priorities that you have when you're integrating will influence the order that you integrate in as well. And each of those decisions that you make will influence the other parts of the system. So sometimes good enough is good enough. We might not necessarily get to a perfect state. And if we try and reach a perfect state, then it might be too late at that point. Okay, so in practice, when we start to think about our design or manufacturing or manufacture, new requirements will emerge. And typically that will change the cost. So we work on all of these different things. And that's, again, we integrate that through because we know if we make this change here, then as we were saying before, it means that there's a change over here needed and actually the overall time it's gonna take is gonna be longer.
